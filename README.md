## About The Project

![Screen Shot](public/Screenshot.png)

The journey started in a Discord call with Pierce DeAnda, Andy Fernandez, and Jaden Monroe. We were playing with tools like Penpot and Figma in which I made the homepage of mine as a joke, but then the color palette and minimalistic design with an offset title grew on me and I stuck to it.

Important takeaways would be responsive design, user experience, and the friends we made along the journey.
